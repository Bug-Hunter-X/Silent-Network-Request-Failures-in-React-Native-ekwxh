# Silent Network Request Failures in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications: silent failures during network requests.  The application attempts to fetch data from an external API. While error handling is in place, it sometimes fails to catch and display errors effectively, leading to a poor user experience.

## Problem

The primary issue is that network requests can fail due to various reasons (CORS, server-side issues, network connectivity) without triggering the `catch` block in the `useEffect` hook.

## Solution

The solution involves adding more robust error handling and potentially implementing better network request monitoring.
